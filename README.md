## About AnilistHeaven

AnilistHeaven is a project I decided to make because I love Anilist and wanna do something fun for the community and improve my skills. It will have many options such as:

- Challenges.
- Badge generation.
- Your list management (Later versions).
- Profile design tools (Still thinkiing about this one).
- And more things if I can think of anything nice

It's gonna be all in one place, I was thinking of even making auto challange filler, like if you're doing "100 days anime challange" You'd just have to pick an anime/manga/character and it would automatically make you a markdown. 

## When will the website go live?

I just started working on it today (**Sunday, May 2, 2021**) so it's gonna take some time since I don't wanna publish an unfinished product. I will write ETA here as soon as I can.

## Will this website be safe?

Absolutely! I will use Anilist API for many things and will not save any data anywhere (Not that I can afford servers even if I wanted to).
